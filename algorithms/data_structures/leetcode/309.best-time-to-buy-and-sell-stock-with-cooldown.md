title: 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
---

This is [a medium problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/).

# Description

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

# C++ Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int size = prices.size();
    if (size < 2) return 0;
    // curr == 1
    // sell := 0 stock is being holding.
    int max_profit_if_sell_curr = max(0, prices[1] - prices[0]);
    int max_profit_if_sell_prev = 0;
    // hold := 1 stock is being holding.
    int max_profit_if_hold_curr = -min(prices[0], prices[1]);
    int max_profit_if_hold_prev = -prices[0];
    auto next = prices.begin() + 1;
    while (++next != prices.end()) {
      auto price_next = *next;
      int max_profit_if_sell_next = max(
          max_profit_if_sell_curr,
          max_profit_if_hold_curr + price_next);
      int max_profit_if_hold_next = max(
          max_profit_if_hold_curr,
          max_profit_if_sell_prev - price_next);
      // shift one day off
      max_profit_if_sell_prev = max_profit_if_sell_curr;
      max_profit_if_hold_prev = max_profit_if_hold_curr;
      max_profit_if_sell_curr = max_profit_if_sell_next;
      max_profit_if_hold_curr = max_profit_if_hold_next;
    }
    return max_profit_if_sell_curr;
  }
};
```

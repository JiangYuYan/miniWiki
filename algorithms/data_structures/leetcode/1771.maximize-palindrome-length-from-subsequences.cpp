 * Testcase Example:  '"cacb"\n"cbba"'
 *
 * You are given two strings, word1 and word2. You want to construct a string
 * in the following manner:
 * 
 * 
 * Choose some non-empty subsequence subsequence1 from word1.
 * Choose some non-empty subsequence subsequence2 from word2.
 * Concatenate the subsequences: subsequence1 + subsequence2, to make the
 * string.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed in the
 * described manner. If no palindromes can be constructed, return 0.
 * 
 * A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be made by deleting some
 * (possibly none) characters from s without changing the order of the
 * remaining characters.
 * 
 * A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwardÂ as well as backward.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "cacb", word2 = "cbba"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "cba" from word2 to make "abcba",
 * which is a palindrome.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "ab"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "a" from word2 to make "aba", which
 * is a palindrome.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "aa", word2 = "bb"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: You cannot construct a palindrome from the described method, so
 * return 0.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 1000
 * word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

title: 435. Non-overlapping Intervals
---

This is [a medium problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/).

# Description

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note:

1. You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
1. Intervals like `[1,2]` and `[2,3]` have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

# C++ Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
    if (intervals.size() == 0) return 0;
    auto cmp = [](auto &lhs, auto &rhs) { return lhs[1] < rhs[1]; };
    sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), cmp);
    auto count = 0;
    auto curr = intervals.begin();
    auto next = curr + 1;
    while (next != intervals.end()) {
      if (curr->back() <= next->front()) curr = next;
      else ++count;
      ++next;
    }
    return count;
  }
};
```
